# AI‑Healthcare‑Triage‑Mental‑Health‑Companion

An AI‑powered companion designed for healthcare triage and mental health support using conversational models. This toolkit aims to assist users with initial triage and emotional support needs, combining intelligent routing with empathetic response.

---

##  Features

- **Healthcare triage**: Helps assess user-reported symptoms or concerns and provides guidance or next steps.
- **Mental health companion**: Offers empathetic conversation and basic emotional support through AI-powered responses.
- **Modular architecture**: Designed for easy extension—plug in different models or integrate new workflows.
- **Lightweight deployment**: Built to run efficiently locally or on lightweight cloud environments.

##  Getting Started

###  Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip or conda for dependency management
- (Optional) `virtualenv` or `venv`

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usamanisarkhan/AI-Healthcare-Triage-Mental-Health-Companion.git
cd AI-Healthcare-Triage-Mental-Health-Companion
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `.env\Scriptsctivate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

- If using the **OpenAI API** or another external model provider, create a `.env` file containing:
  
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
  ```

- Configure any model-specific settings (e.g. model names, API endpoints) within `config.py` or relevant modules.

### Running the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Depending on your implementation, the app may:
- Launch a local web server (e.g. Flask / FastAPI) for interactive use.
- Run a CLI interface for input/output.
- Expose endpoints for integration with other services.

##  Usage Examples

**Triage Mode:**

```python
from companion import Companion

comp = Companion(mode="triage")
response = comp.handle("I’ve been feeling dizzy and nauseated for the last two days.")
print("AI Triage Recommendation:", response)
```

**Companion Mode:**

```python
comp = Companion(mode="mental_health")
response = comp.handle("I’m feeling anxious and overwhelmed lately.")
print("AI Companion Response:", response)
```

*(Adapt the API above to your actual method signatures.)*

##  Troubleshooting

###  Error: `429 – insufficient_quota` or API Limit Exceeded

- Indicates that your model usage quota (for services like OpenAI) has been depleted.
- **Solution:** Check and top-up your billing plan or apply for more quota through your provider’s dashboard.

###  General Tips

- **Model not loading?** Ensure paths in `models/` are correct and model files are present.
- **Slow performance?** Consider using lighter models or optimizing token usage.
- **Unexpected outputs?** Clean your model inputs and validate API responses.
